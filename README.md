# Predicting-Titanic-Survivors
Predict Survivors from Titanic using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and compare the accuracy
The dataset set we have selected for analysis consists of the passengers of the titanic and the features of their trip. These features have been collected for each of the passengers and they include simple information about name, age and sex but they also include much more significant datasets. These are, the passenger class, whether they survived the sinking or not, the number of siblings/ spouses aboard, the number of parents/children aboard, the ticket number, the passenger fare paid, the port of embarkation, which lifeboat the survived on if they did, and what order the body was recovered. Certain of the factors are much more interesting to us, we do know hearing the stories of people who survived, that the first people asked to evacuate were women and children. We also do know that the survival rate was much higher for those in a higher-class cabin. We do want to see if the data we have backs these statements.
